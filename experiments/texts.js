                   to investigate whether people can intentionally forget information they want to forget, \
                   and whether this is accomplished better when more time is available for forgetting. To \
                   that end we tested, in the last trial, your memory for the blue words, which you were \
                   supposed to forget. We varied the free time following each of the blue words - either only \
                   200 ms or 1500 ms after each blue word. We expect that participants who had longer free \
                   time following the blue words are able to remember fewer of them.</p><p>Please do not share \
                   this information with anyone! It is crucial the explanation is kept confidential until we \
                   have collected all data.</p><p>Here is your code to confirm your participation: WMCspan-2</p>\
